I'm not gonna wear my heart,
darling, on my sleeve

You talk too much
for someone who said listen please

Filled with hurt, girl

I'll convert her to me

Filled with doubt

Stiles, what the hell are you doing?

You weren't answering your phone.

Why do you have a bat?

I thought you were a predator.

A pre...

Look, I know it's late,
but you gotta hear this.


 


I saw my dad leave 20 minutes ago.
Dispatch called.

They're bringing in every officer
from the Beacon Department,

and even state police.

For what?

Two joggers found a body in the woods.

- A dead body?
- No, a body of water.

Yes, dumb-ass, a dead body.

- You mean like, murdered?
- Nobody knows yet.

Just that it was a girl,
probably in her 20s.

Hold on, if they found the body,
then what are they looking for?

That's the best part. They only found half.

We're going.

We're seriously doing this?

You're the one always bitching that
nothing ever happens in this town.


 


I was trying to get a good night's
sleep before practice tomorrow.

Right, 'cause sitting on the bench
is such a grueling effort.

No, because I'm playing this year.
In fact, I'm making first line.

Hey, that's the spirit.

Everyone should have a dream,
even a pathetically unrealistic one.

Just out of curiosity,
which half of the body are we looking for?

Huh!

I didn't even think about that.

And, what if whoever killed the body
is still out here?

Also something I didn't think about.

It's comforting to know
you've planned this out

with your usual attention to detail.

I know.

Maybe the severe asthmatic should be
the one holding the flashlight, huh?

- Wait, come on!
- Stiles!

Wait up! Stiles!

Stiles!

Hold it right there!

Hang on, hang on.

This little delinquent belongs to me.

Dad, how are you doing?

So, do you listen in
to all of my phone calls?

No.

Not the boring ones.

Now, where's your usual partner in crime?

Who, Scott?

Scott's home.

He said he wanted to get
a good night's sleep for

the first day back at school tomorrow.

It's just me. In the woods. Alone.

Scott, you out there?

Scott?

Well, young man,
I'm gonna walk you back to your car.

And you and I

are gonna have a conversation about
something called invasion of privacy.

Ah!

My inhaler.

Aah! Oh! Oh!

Aah!

Everybody runs when the telephone rings

But nobody's making a call

Want to see what it's like
to be living out there

I want to see what it's like
when we break down the wall

Dude, watch the paint job.

Yo, Jackson, let's go, bro.

Like a dormant virus
getting ready to spread

Okay, let's see this thing.

Ooh!

Yeah. Whoa!

It was too dark to see much,
but I'm pretty sure it was a wolf.

- A wolf bit you?
- Uh-huh.

No, not a chance.

- I heard a wolf howling.
- No, you didn't.

What do you mean, "No, I didn't"?
How do you know what I heard?

Because California
doesn't have wolves, okay?

Not in like 60 years.

- Really?
- Yes, really.

There are no wolves in California.

All right, well, if you don't believe me
about the wolf,

then you're definitely not gonna believe me
about when I tell you

I found the body.

Are you kidding me?

No, man, I wish.
I'm gonna have nightmares for a month.

Oh, God, that is freakin' awesome.

I mean, this is seriously gonna be the best
thing that's happened to this town since...

Since the birth of Lydia Martin.
Hey, Lydia, you look...

like you're gonna ignore me.

- You're the cause of this, you know.
- Uh-huh.

Draggin' me down to your nerd depths.
I'm a nerd by association.

I've been scarlet nerded by you.

As you all know, there indeed was a body
found in the woods last night.

And I am sure your eager little minds
are coming up with various

macabre scenarios as to what happened.

But I am here to tell you

that the police have a suspect in custody,

which means
you can give your undivided attention

to the syllabus which is on your desk
outlining this semester.

Mom, three calls on my first day
is a little overdoing it.

Everything except a pen.

Oh, my God, I didn't actually forget a pen.

Okay, okay. I gotta go. Love ya.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

So you were saying
San Francisco isn't where you grew up?

No, but we lived there for more
than a year, which is unusual in my family.

Well, hopefully Beacon Hills
will be your last stop for a while.

Class, this is our new student,
Allison Argent.

Please do your best
to make her feel welcome.

Thanks.

We'll begin with Kafka's
Metamorphosis, on page 133.

I got your name
Got your notebook

Cell phone Look up relation

An invitation to die

That jacket is absolutely killer.

Where'd you get it?

My mom was a buyer
for a boutique back in San Francisco.

And you are my new best friend.

Hey, Jackson.

Can someone tell me
how new girl is here all of five minutes,

and she's already hanging out
with Lydia's clique?

Because she's hot.

Beautiful people herd together.

So, this weekend, there's a party.

A party?

Yeah. Friday night.
You should come.

Uh, I can't. It's family night this Friday.
Thanks for asking.

You sure? I mean,
everyone's going after the scrimmage.

You mean like football?

Football's a joke in Beacon.
The sport here is lacrosse.

We've won the state championship
for the past three years.

Because of a certain team captain.

Well, we have practice in a few minutes.

That is, if you don't have anywhere else...

- Well, I was going to...
- Perfect. You're coming.

But if you play,
I'll have no one to talk to on the bench.

Are you really gonna do that
to your best friend?

I can't sit out again.
My whole life is sitting on the sidelines.

This season, I make first line.

Walk home I should have
come home already

It was taking too long
It was taking too long

- McCall!
- Yeah?

You're on goal.

- I've never played.
- I know.

Scoring some shots
will give the boys a confidence boost.

It's a first day back thing.

Get 'em energized, fired up!

What about me?

Try not to take any in the face.

Let's go! Come on!

Who is that?

Him? I'm not sure who he is.

Why?

He's in my English class.

Hey, way to catch with your face, McCall!

Me press trigger
Me nah press people button

Nah badda chat come face

Yeah!

Like how me have 22
Inna mi somethin'

Ten haf'-a use so
Forget the next dozen, fool

Whoa!

He seems like he's pretty good.

Yeah, very good.

Anytime they ready
Punahussy start war

See who now fi spread it out
More pon di tar

My style is the bomb

Diggi bomb, di dang
Di dang, diggi diggi

Oh, God.

My style is the bomb

That is my friend!

Whoo!

My style is the bomb

Diggi bomb, di dang
Di dang, diggi diggi

Carubuano peer with the bomb

Di dang, di dang
Diggi diggi bomb

Di dang, di dang Diggi diggi

I don't know what it was. It was like I had
all the time in the world to catch the ball.

And that's not the only weird thing.

I can hear stuff I shouldn't
be able to hear. Smell things.

Smell things? Like what?

Like Mint Mojito gum in your pocket.

I don't even have any Mint Mojito...

So all this started with a bite.

What if it's like an infection, like my
body's flooding with adrenaline

before I go into shock or something?

You know what?
I actually think I've heard of this.

It's a specific kind of infection.

- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

Yeah, I think it's called lycanthropy.

What's that? Is that bad?

Oh, yeah, it's the worst.

But only once a month.

- Once a month?
- Mmm-hmm.

On the night of the full moon.

Hey, man...

Hey, you're the one
who heard a wolf howling.

Hey, there could be something
seriously wrong with me.

I know! You're a werewolf!

Okay, obviously I'm kidding.

But if you see me in shop class
trying to melt all the silver I can find,

it's 'cause Friday's a full moon.

No, I could have sworn this was it.

I saw the body, the deer came running.

I dropped my inhaler.

Maybe the killer moved the body.

If he did, I hope he left my inhaler.
Those things are like 80 bucks.

Oh.

What are you doing here?

Huh?

This is private property.

Uh, sorry, man, we didn't know.

Yeah, we were just looking
for something, but...

Uh, forget it.

All right, come on, man,
I gotta get to work.

Dude, that was Derek Hale.

You remember, right?
He's only like a few years older than us.

- Remember what?
- His family.

They all burned to death in a fire,
like, 10 years ago.

I wonder what he's doing back.

Come on.

Hey, kitties.

I didn't see it.

I took my eyes off the road for,

like, two seconds to change the song on
my iPod, and then this dog,

it just came out of nowhere!

It's all right, it's all right.

Do you remember where it happened
so I can send Animal Control to find it?

No! I mean, yes,
I know where I hit it, but the dog is...

- Where is it?
- It's in my car.

You okay?

She's just frightened.

That makes two of us.

Let me see if I have any better luck.

I think her leg is broken.

I've seen the doctor do plenty of splints.

I can do it myself
and then give her a painkiller for now.

Yeah, I have a shirt in my bag.

Oh, I don't want to trouble you.

Here.

What?

I didn't see anything.

Thanks for doing this.
I feel really stupid.

How come?

I don't know.
'Cause I freaked out like a total girl.

You are a girl.

I freaked out like a girly girl,
and I'm not a girly girl.

What kind of girl are you?

Tougher than that.

At least, I thought I was.

Hey, I'd be freaked out, too.

In fact, I'd probably cry.

And not like a man, either.
Like the biggest girly girl ever.

- It'd be pathetic.
- Yeah, right.

So, it looks like she's gonna live.

And I'm pretty sure she'll even
let you pet her now, if you want.

I don't think so.

Oh, come on. You don't want her to sue.

I hear this breed is very litigious.

Please forgive me

If I'm not always what you want

You see?

She likes you.

What?

I don't know. Sorry.

You have an eyelash on your cheek.

Oh. It's from the crying.

Standing there empty

The ice break

I can hear your thoughts

Thanks.

Yeah.

So, um, I was wondering...

I mean...

Is it really family night on Friday,

or do you think maybe you'd like to go
to that party with me?

Family night was a total lie.

So is that a yes, you'll go?

Definitely yes.

How can you do this?

We both know that it's wrong

But we keep it going on and on

If it's so clear, then

Why can't you help yourself?

It's people like you that

Always look for someone else to blame

Good morning.

All right, little man.

How 'bout you tell me
where you're getting your juice.

- What?
- Where are you getting your juice?

My mom does all the grocery shopping.

Now, listen, McCall,

you're gonna tell me exactly what it is
and who you're buying it from,

because there's no way in hell you're out
there kicking ass on the field like that

without some sort of chemical boost.

Oh, you mean steroids.

Are you on steroids?

What the hell is going on with you, McCall?

What's going on with me?
You really wanna know?

Well, so would I!

Because I can see, hear, and smell things

that I shouldn't be able
to see, hear, and smell.

I do things that should be impossible,
I'm sleepwalking

three miles into the middle
of the woods, and I'm pretty much

convinced that I'm totally
out of my freaking mind!

You think you're funny. Don't you, McCall?

I know you're hiding something.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

I don't care how long it takes.

Scott! Scott, wait up.

Stiles, I'm playing the first elimination,
man, can it wait?

Just hold on, okay?
I overheard my dad on the phone.

The fiber analysis came back
from the lab in LA.

They found animal hairs on the body
from the woods!

- Stiles, I gotta go.
- Wait, no! Scott!

You're not gonna believe
what the animal was!

It was a wolf.

Let's go! Gather round!

Bring it in, come on!

Come on!

Got a question, McCall?

- What?
- You raised your hand.

- You have a question?
- Oh, no. I was just, uh...

Nothing. Sorry.

Okay. You know how this goes.

If you don't make the cut,

you're most likely sitting on the bench
for the rest of the season.

You make the cut, you play.
Your parents are proud.

Your girlfriend loves ya!

Huh?

Everything else is

cream cheese.

Now, get out there
and show me what you got!

- Come on!
- Let's go! Let's go!

Because the sun came out to shine

All my dreams came true last night

Because the sun came out to shine

Let it shine

Let it shine

But don't let the sun see you cry

Ooh!

McCall! Get over here!

What in God's name was that?

This is a lacrosse field.

What, are you trying out
for the gymnastics team?

- No, Coach.
- What the hell was that?

I don't know.
I was just trying to make the shot.

Yeah, well, you made the shot.

And guess what?

You're startin', buddy.

You made first line.

Come on!

First line!

Get in. You gotta see this thing.

I've been up all night reading.
Websites, books. All this information.

How much Adderall have you had today?

A lot. Doesn't matter. Okay, just listen.

Oh, is this about the body?
Did they find out who did it?

No, they're still questioning people,
even Derek Hale.

Oh, the guy in the woods
that we saw the other day.

Yeah! Yes. But that's not it, okay?

- What, then?
- Remember the joke from the other day?

Not a joke anymore.

The wolf. The bite in the woods.

I started doing all this reading.
Do you even know why a wolf howls?

- Should I?
- It's a signal, okay?

When a wolf's alone, it howls to signal
its location to the rest of the pack.

So if you heard a wolf howling, that means
others could have been nearby.

- Maybe even a whole pack of 'em.
- A whole pack of wolves?

No, werewolves.

Are you seriously
wasting my time with this?

You know I'm picking up Allison in an hour.

I saw you on the field today, Scott.

Okay, what you did wasn't just amazing,
all right? It was impossible.

- Yeah, so I made a good shot.
- No, you made an incredible shot,

I mean, the way you moved, your speed,
your reflexes.

People can't just suddenly
do that overnight.

And there's the vision and the senses,

and don't even think I don't notice
you don't need your inhaler anymore.

Okay! Dude, I can't think about this now.

- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? What? No!

The full moon's tonight. Don't you get it?

What are you trying to do?
I just made first line.

I got a date with a girl who I can't
believe wants to go out with me,

and everything in my life is somehow
perfect. Why are you trying to ruin it?

I'm trying to help.

You're cursed, Scott.

You know, and it's not just the moon
will cause you to physically change.

It also just so happens to be
when your bloodlust will be at its peak.

- Bloodlust?
- Yeah, your urge to kill.

I'm already starting to feel
an urge to kill, Stiles.

You gotta hear this.

"The change can be caused by anger
or anything that raises your pulse."

All right? I haven't seen anyone
raise your pulse like Allison does.

You gotta cancel this date.
I'm gonna call her right now.

- What are you doing?
- I'm canceling the date.

No, give it to me!

I'm sorry.

I gotta go get ready for that party.

I'm sorry.

Mom!

Is this a party or a date?

Maybe both.

- And her name is...
- Allison.

Allison. Nice.

Thank you.

We don't need to have a talk, do we?

Mom, I'm not having the safe sex talk
with you.

Oh, my God.

No, I meant about keeping the tank full.
Give me those back.

Are you serious?

You bet your ass I am serious.

I'm not gonna end up
on some reality television show

with a pregnant 16-year-old.

Come on!

The kids are disco dancing

They're tired of rock and roll

I tried to tell 'em, hey

But they don't wanna listen

- You okay?
- What? Yeah. I'm fine.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The Internet killed the video star

Are you okay?

I'll be right back.

Yo, Scott, you good?

Are you okay?

Allison.

I'm a friend of Scott's.

My name's Derek.

- Go away.
- Scott, it's me.

Let me in, Scott. I can help.

No! Listen, you gotta find Allison.

She's fine, all right?
I saw her get a ride from the party.

- She's totally fine.
- No, I think I know who it is.

You just let me in. We can try...

It's Derek. Derek Hale is the werewolf.
He's the one that bit me.

He's the one that killed
the girl in the woods.

Scott, Derek's the one
who drove Allison from the party.

Scott!

Come on, come on, come on.

Hi, Mrs. Argent. You have no idea who I am.
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

Uh, look, this is gonna
sound kind of crazy,

really crazy, actually.

- You know what? Crazy doesn't...
- Allison! It's for you.

Where is she?

She's safe. From you.

- What did you do with her?
- Shh! Quiet.

Too late. They're already here. Run.

Take him.

Aah!

- Who were they?
- Hunters.

The kind that have been
hunting us for centuries.

Us? You mean you! You did this to me!

Is it really so bad, Scott?
That you can see better,

hear more clearly, move faster
than any human could ever hope?

You've been given something
that most people would kill for.

The bite is a gift.

I don't want it.

You will.

And you're gonna need me
if you want to learn how to control it.

So you and me, Scott, we're brothers now.

You know what actually
worries me the most?

If you say Allison,
I'm gonna punch you in the head.

She probably hates me now.

Ugh.

I doubt that.

But you might want to come up
with a pretty amazing apology.

Or, you know, you could
just tell her the truth

and revel in the awesomeness of the
fact that you're a frickin' werewolf.

Okay, bad idea.

Hey, we'll get through this.

Come on, if I have to, I'll chain
you up myself on full moon nights

and feed you live mice.

I had a boa once. I could do it.

So what happened?
You left me stranded at the party.

Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm really sorry, I am.

But you're gonna have to trust
that I had a really good reason.

Did you get sick?

I definitely had an attack of something.

Am I gonna get an explanation?

Can you just find it in your heart
to trust me on this one?

Am I gonna regret this?

Probably.

So is that a yes on a second chance?

Definitely yes.

That's my dad. I better go.
